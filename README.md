# GoFish

Using a deck of cards to simulate a game of Go Fish between several computer players!

*Here is the game online:  https://cardgames.io/gofish/.*



Here are the Go Fish rules:

- At the start of each game, the deck is shuffled and cut.  Then 5 cards are dealt out to each of the four players.  Each player keeps their cards in their hand and can look at them.

- If any player has a "book" (also called a "trick") in their hand - i.e., 4 cards of the same rank, they "play" that book by placing those 4 cards in front of them, face-up so other players can see them.  Each book played is worth one point.  The object of the game is to get more points than any of your opponents.

- If any player plays all of the cards in their hand as a book, they then immediately draw 4 more cards from the deck.

- From this point forward, players take turns moving in a clockwise direction.  When it is a player's turn, they choose a rank from among the ranks currently in their hand and then select another player that they think might have cards of that same rank.  They then ask that player by name if they have any cards of that rank.  For example, "Jeffery, give me all your Eights!"

- If the-player-who-was-asked has any cards of that rank, they must hand them over to the current player.  The current player then immediately gets another turn.

- If the current player completes a book after receiving cards from another player, the current player must immediately play that book adding another point to their total.

- If the-player-who-was-asked does not have any cards of that rank, they yell "GO FISH!"  The current player then draws a card from the deck and their turn is over.

- Players continue taking turns until all books are played.  If a player runs out of cards and the deck is empty, that player no longer gets a turn.

- After all 13 books have been played, the player with the most points wins.
